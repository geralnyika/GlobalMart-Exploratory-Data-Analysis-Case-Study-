# **Project Overview**
This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) case study that uses transactional retail data to analyze GlobalMart's sales performance, profitability, and customer trends. Finding useful business insights about product performance, regional profitability, discount tactics, and seasonal demand is the goal of the analysis, as is clearly conveying those insights to decision-makers.

# **Business Questions**
The analysis focuses on answering the following key questions:
- Which products generate the highest sales versus the highest profit?
- Are there products with high sales but low or negative profitability?
- How does performance vary across regions?
- Which product categories drive the most revenue?
- Are there seasonal trends in sales?
- How do discounts impact profitability?

# **Key Insights** 
- Sales ≠ Profit: Some high-revenue products and regions consistently generate low or negative profit.
- Regional Opportunity: While certain regions lead in sales volume, others outperform in profitability which indicates opportunities for cost or pricing optimisation.
- Category Performance: Technology products drive the highest revenue, followed by Office Supplies and Furniture.
- Seasonality: Sales peak toward the end of the year, suggesting strong seasonal demand.
- Discount Trade-off: Discounts increase sales but can significantly erode profit if not strategically managed.

# **Summary**
According to the analysis, GlobalMart can increase profitability by prioritizing margin-driven decision-making over raw sales volume. The company can strike a balance between expansion and long-term profitability by investing in high-performing categories, optimizing underperforming regions, and implementing a more controlled discount strategy. By using a data-driven approach, pricing, promotions, and regional strategies are guaranteed to be based on facts rather than conjecture.
